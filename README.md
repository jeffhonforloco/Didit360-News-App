Didit360 News App - Cloud Infrastructure and Deployment Guide
This guide provides a detailed outline for setting up and managing the Didit360 News App cloud infrastructure, addressing best practices for a seamless deployment and operation. Follow these steps to ensure proper configuration and maintenance.

1. Tech Stack
Backend Language: Node.js (v18.x LTS)
Frontend Framework: React (v18.x)
Database: PostgreSQL (v15.x)
Caching Layer: Redis (v7.x)
Deployment Platform: Docker (v24.x) with Kubernetes (v1.28)
Load Balancer: NGINX (v1.25.x)
Monitoring Tools: Prometheus, Grafana
Message Broker: RabbitMQ (v3.x) for async operations (optional, based on app design).

2. How to Run the App
Prerequisites:
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
Node.js (v18.x LTS)
npm (v9.x) or yarn (v1.22.x)
Docker and Docker Compose
PostgreSQL and Redis running locally or accessible via connection strings





Steps to Run:
Local Environment
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/didit360/news-app.git
cd news-app
Install dependencies:
npm install
Set environment variables (create a .env file in the root directory):
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=didit360
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
Build the project:
npm run build
Start the application:
npm start
Alternatively, for hot reloading during development:
npm run dev
Dockerized Environment
Build and run using Docker Compose:
docker-compose up --build



3. Dependencies
Required:
Redis: For caching and session management.
PostgreSQL: Primary database for structured data.
NGINX: Reverse proxy and load balancing.
Environment Variables Management: Recommended .env files or tools like AWS Secrets Manager.


4. Environment Variable Setup
Example Configuration
Database Connection:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=your_database
CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/your_database
Redis Configuration:
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
JWT Authentication:
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
JWT_EXPIRY=3600
Application Configurations:
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080

Notes:
Use tools like dotenv for managing environment variables locally.
For cloud environments, use secure key management systems like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault.

5. Deployment Best Practices
Shared Storage:
Use shared storage for static assets (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
Configure CDN (e.g., CloudFront) for faster content delivery.
Logging:
Use centralized logging systems (e.g., ELK stack or CloudWatch).
Ensure application logs are structured (JSON format).
Monitoring and Alerts:
Implement Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and dashboards.
Set up alerts for critical issues (e.g., database downtime, high memory usage).
Scaling:
Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes (configure pods for stateless services).
Use autoscalers for high traffic events.
Security:
Secure APIs with HTTPS (via SSL certificates).
Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
Configure IAM roles and policies for cloud resources.
CI/CD:
Use pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD) for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
Run tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end) as part of CI/CD.





6. Additional Considerations
Database Migrations:
Use tools like Sequelize CLI, TypeORM CLI, or Knex.js for managing migrations.
Ensure migration scripts are idempotent.
Data Backup:
Set up automated backups for PostgreSQL and Redis.
Verify backups regularly for data integrity.
Documentation:
Maintain an up-to-date README for developers.
Provide API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI).
Error Handling:
Implement global error handling and meaningful error codes.
